Inspired by a triptych artwork, this project presents an interactive 3D simulation that visually models the operations of a space telescope organization using [three.js](https://threejs.org/). The animation depicts celestial bodies emitting data, which satellites collect and transmit to Earth using dynamic particle streams along smooth, curved paths. Key visual details include glowing planets, detailed satellites, vibrant data flows, and a densely populated starfield—all rendered with optimized performance for modern browsers and interactive camera controls. The color scheme and movement faithfully capture the essence of the original artwork while enabling user exploration of the space data transmission workflow.

**Key Features:**
- Real-time orbital mechanics for celestial bodies and satellites  
- Data emission and transmission visualized via animated particle systems  
- Interactive controls using OrbitControls and intuitive camera movement  
- Pure HTML/JavaScript implementation—no build tools required  
- Atmospheric effects, glow, and dynamic lighting for visual depth
