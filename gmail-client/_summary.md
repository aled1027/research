Built using Node.js/Express and the Gmail API, this project delivers a minimal, browser-based Gmail client with secure OAuth2 login, real-time inbox access, and email management. The intuitive Pico.css frontend allows users to view, search, read, compose, and delete emails—plus mark them as read automatically. Key Gmail features like query-based search and HTML email rendering are supported, and common tasks such as sending or trashing emails are streamlined via concise RESTful API endpoints. To run locally, users configure OAuth2 credentials from the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/) and launch with one command. The open-source codebase encourages customization for personal or team productivity needs ([see project repo](https://github.com/googleapis/google-api-nodejs-client)).

**Key features:**
- Secure Google sign-in and session management
- Fast inbox browsing, searching (Gmail syntax), and pagination
- Read, send, mark as read, and delete emails efficiently
- Modern, lightweight interface with Pico.css
- Easily extensible with Node.js and Express
