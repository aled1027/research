Designed to reinforce core Three.js rendering concepts, the Layering Quiz presents 20 interactive multiple-choice questions that challenge users to predict visual outcomes based on specific material settings—covering depth testing, depth writing, render order, and blending modes. Each question not only assesses theoretical knowledge but also provides instant feedback, detailed explanations, and a live Three.js render illustrating the correct answer. The quiz supports structured learning by organizing questions into focused categories and integrates with the [Three.js Layering Demo](../threejs-layering/index.html), encouraging hands-on experimentation. Scoring and feedback mechanisms help users identify and target common mistakes in transparency, depth, and blending configuration.

**Key features & findings:**
- Highlights frequent errors, such as incorrect depthWrite settings on transparent objects and improper renderOrder usage.
- Reinforces when to use additive, multiply, or normal blending for various visual effects.
- Distinguishes effects of material type and settings on rendered outcomes.
- Built entirely with vanilla JavaScript and [Three.js](https://threejs.org/) ES6 modules for direct browser use.
