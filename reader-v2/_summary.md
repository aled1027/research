Reader v2 is a minimalist reading application that integrates sophisticated typographic features inspired by [TODS: Typography and OpenType Default Stylesheet](https://clagnut.com/blog/2433) to enhance on-screen reading comfort and fidelity. The app supports rich text input (including Google Docs formatting) and boasts modern OpenType features like ligatures, optical sizing, and language-aware quotes, as well as automatic dark mode with carefully tuned colors to minimize eye strain. It prioritizes a design philosophy where the interface fades away, allowing full immersion in the text, while all enhancements degrade gracefully in unsupported browsers. Reader v2 is delivered as a single, offline-capable HTML file requiring no external dependencies or data storage.

**Key features:**
- Professional typography: ligatures, kerning, hyphenation, optical sizing, smart quotes, and figure styles  
- Thoughtful dark mode design for reduced "bloom" and visual fatigue  
- Fully browser-based with no user data collection or internet requirement
