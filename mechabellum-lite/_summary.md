Mechabellum Lite is a browser-based adaptation of the strategic mech auto-battler [Mechabellum](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechabellum), built with [Phaser 3](https://phaser.io/). The project replicates core gameplay mechanics, including supply-based unit purchasing, deployment phases, and a rock-paper-scissors counter system, all running directly from `index.html` without a build step or external assets. Players select difficulty, buy and upgrade units, and face an AI that dynamically adapts its composition to counter player strategies. The game features procedural sprite generation, reinforcement card-driven upgrades, and scalable visuals, providing a streamlined but tactical auto-battler experience in the browser.

**Key highlights:**
- Fully browser-based; no installation or build step required.
- Dynamic AI opponent adapts to player’s unit composition.
- Reinforcement cards and tech upgrades enhance strategic depth.
- Procedurally generated graphics ensure zero asset dependencies.
- Supports varied unit types, deployment mechanics, and strategic counterplay.
