Inspired by human-centered UX principles, the Reader App is a minimalist web application designed to enhance the experience of reading long-form prose and fiction. The app focuses on usability and comfort, implementing research-backed decisions in typography, layout, color, and interaction to minimize distractions and promote immersion. It supports rich text input (e.g., from Google Docs), responsive design, and intuitive, low-friction navigation via keyboard, mouse, or touch — all within a standalone HTML file with no dependencies or data collection. Controls and UI elements are hidden by default and only revealed on interaction, ensuring the reading experience remains central.

**Key features and findings:**
- Optimal reading comfort through Georgia serif font, ideal line length (55-75 chars), and soft color scheme.
- Progressive disclosure of UI, fading controls when inactive for minimum visual clutter.
- Full offline support and privacy, with no external data storage or tracking.
- Efficient pagination boosts spatial memory, while navigation is accessible via multiple input methods.
